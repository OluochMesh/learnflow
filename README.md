**📋 Project Overview**
This is a Learning Progress Tracker web application built with HTML, JavaScript, and what appears to be a Python backend (based on the template syntax). The application helps users track their learning progress through visual charts and insights.

**🚧 Current Status - INCOMPLETE**
This project is currently unfinished and contains several issues that need to be resolved before it can function properly.

**❌ Known Issues**
JavaScript Errors
The application currently has multiple JavaScript syntax errors that prevent it from working correctly:

Template Syntax Conflicts: Django template syntax ({% %}) is incorrectly mixed with JavaScript code

Missing Quotes: String values are not properly quoted in some places

Error Handling Problems: The try-catch structure is malformed

Parsing Issues: Data from the backend is not being properly parsed in the frontend

Functional Limitations
Chart rendering is not working due to JavaScript errors

Data visualization is incomplete

Insight generation may not function correctly

🛠️ Technical Stack
Frontend: HTML, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Appears to be Python-based (Django/Flask) based on template syntax

Charts: Chart.js library for data visualization

Styling: Tailwind CSS for responsive design

🔧 What Needs to Be Fixed
Separate template syntax from JavaScript

Properly handle Django template variables in JavaScript context

Use JSON parsing with proper quoting

Fix error handling structure

Implement proper try-catch blocks

Separate error handling for different chart types

Ensure data parsing works correctly

Verify data format between backend and frontend

Add proper fallbacks for missing data

Test chart rendering

Ensure Chart.js is properly included

Verify chart data format matches expected structure

🎯 Planned Features
Based on the code, the application is designed to include:

Line chart showing learning entries per day

Pie chart showing understanding level distribution

Progress insights with personalized recommendations

Responsive design for mobile and desktop

Error handling for missing data
